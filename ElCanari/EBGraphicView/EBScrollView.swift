  //····················································································································
  // The six NSDraggingDestination methods are invoked in a distinct order:
  //
  // ① As the image is dragged into the destination’s boundaries, the destination is sent a draggingEntered: message.
  //       The method should return a value that indicates which dragging operation the destination will perform.
  // ② While the image remains within the destination, a series of draggingUpdated: messages are sent.
  //       The method should return a value that indicates which dragging operation the destination will perform.
  // ③ If the image is dragged out of the destination, draggingExited: is sent and the sequence of
  //       NSDraggingDestination messages stops. If it re-enters, the sequence begins again (with a new
  //       draggingEntered: message).
  // ④ When the image is released, it either slides back to its source (and breaks the sequence) or a
  //       prepareForDragOperation: message is sent to the destination, depending on the value returned by the most
  //       recent invocation of draggingEntered: or draggingUpdated:.
  // ⑤  If the prepareForDragOperation: message returned YES, a performDragOperation: message is sent.
  // ⑥  Finally, if performDragOperation: returned YES, concludeDragOperation: is sent.
